/**
 * Evidence events emitted through AgentExecuteOptions.callbacks.onEvidence.
 *
 * These events describe observations made by Stagehand during an agent run.
 * They are emitted in temporal order; consumers should treat the stream as
 * sequential. An agent-role screenshot applies to every subsequent
 * step_finished until a newer agent-role screenshot replaces it — a CUA
 * provider may choose multiple actions from a single screenshot, so each of
 * those steps shares that frame. A step_observed/probe applies to all
 * step_finished events received since the last probe. Verifier-specific
 * storage and normalization live in the evals/verifier layers.
